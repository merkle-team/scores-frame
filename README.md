This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It utilizes `shadcn` for some core components and all data requests are done with `@tanstack/react-query` wrappers.

`FarcasterApiClient` implementation and `List` component are stripped-down versions of what Warpcast team has built for Warpcast clients.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
